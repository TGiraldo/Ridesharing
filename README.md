# Ridesharing

## About Divvy
Divvy is Chicago's bike share system across Chicago. Divvy provides residents and visitors with a convenient, fun and affordable transportation option for getting around and exploring Chicago.

For this project, I was interested in exploring operational questions that can help improve efficiency and strategic planning of fleet throughout the city of Chicago. 

## Objective
The goal of this task is to analyze ride data to in order to derive insights about how users travel around the city with Divvy. By learning about customer pick up behavior such as trip duration, trip location, distance, and schedule, we can develop a strategy to deal with operational challenges such as demand planning.
